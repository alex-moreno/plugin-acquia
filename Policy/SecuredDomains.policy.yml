  SSL enables your web application to use the HTTPS secure web protocol to
  safely communicate with your users online. To use SSL, your environment must
  have an SSL certificate, which you must purchase from a Certificate Authority
  (CA) or SSL certificate vendor and upload to Acquia Cloud.

  Please review Acquia documentation on enabling SSL at https://docs.acquia.com/en/stable/acquia-cloud/manage/ssl/

  There are registered domains that do not contain SSL support directly on
  Acquia Cloud. In some cases the SSL for these domains are offloaded prior to
  the request reaching Acquia Cloud such as when **Acquia Cloud Edge** is in
  use.
